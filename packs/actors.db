See <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Rules</span></a> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=1&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Listing</span></a> for the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Cantrips</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bardic Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Magical Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><em>2nd-level bard feature</em><br />If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.</p>\n\n<p><b>Jack of All Trades</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Song of Rest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bard College</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Player's Handbook</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bardic Versatility</b></p>\n<p><em>4th-level bard feature</em><br />Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change in focus as you use your skills and magic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace one of the skills you chose for the Expertise feature with one of your other skill proficiencies that isn’t benefiting from Expertise.</li>\n<li>Replace one cantrip you learned from this class’s Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the bard spell list.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Font of Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Countercharm</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{frightened} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{charmed}. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} ends early if you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated} or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Magical Secrets</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines.

class=\"No-Break\">The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&amp;D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the <a title=\"rules on firearms\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Firearms\">rules on firearms</a> in the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em> and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Magical Tinkering</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li>\n<li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li>\n<li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</p>\n<p>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<p><b>Infuse Item</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusionsKnown\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusions Known</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “<a title=\"Artificer Infusions\" href=\"#ArtificerInfusions-1131764\">Artificer Infusions</a>” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusinganItem\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusing an Item</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>” in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time.

class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Artificer","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":1131501,"type":"class","dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Artificer"},"class":"Artificer","importId":"Zc1xh8ZYyUcYbkYW"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Artificer"}}},"img":"icons/magic/light/beam-rays-orange-large.webp","effects":[],"_id":"YjFPGrN5ICOEuyqZ","folder":null,"sort":108,"ownership":{"default":0,"4RNrbf80U3VftR5b":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663358601519,"modifiedTime":1663358601927,"lastModifiedBy":"4RNrbf80U3VftR5b"}},{"name":"Artificer Infusions","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item.</p>\n<p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>\n<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level.

Choose one of the following options. </p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></p>\n<p><em>2nd-level ranger feature</em><br />You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} to cast spells, much as a druid does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Ranger)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=5&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the ranger spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Awareness</b></p>\n<p><em>3rd-level ranger feature, which replaces the Primeval Awareness feature</em><br />You can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don’t already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PrimalAwarenessSpellsTable\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude\">Primal Awareness Spells</h5>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Ranger Level</th>\n<th>Spell</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>speak with animals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>beast sense</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>speak with plants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>locate creature</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>commune with @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Versatility</b></p>\n<p><em>4th-level ranger feature</em><br />Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to rangers. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Nature’s Veil</b></p>\n<p><em>10th-level ranger feature, which replaces the Hide in Plain Sight feature</em></p>\n<p>You draw on the powers of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} to hide yourself from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically become @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible}, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible} creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{blinded} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{deafened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) two shortswords or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two simple melee weapons</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 89","identifier":"ranger","levels":2,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"fB7QfIaBBJCf4loR","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"DKxCxRiFQnVD7U5R","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"favored-foe","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"n":1,"die":4},"6":{"n":1,"die":6},"14":{"n":1,"die":8}}},"value":{},"title":"Favored Foe","icon":""}],"saves":["str","dex"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ani","ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste","sur"],"value":["ani","sur","ins"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"wis"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":91390164,"definitionId":5,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"spellSlotDivisor":2,"spellCastingAbility":"wis","importId":"YUCy9KE5oS1ko2ir"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Ranger"}}},"img":"icons/weapons/bows/shortbow-recurve-yellow.webp","effects":[],"_id":"4xA7XR9ZovQUji6a","folder":null,"sort":20001,"ownership":{"default":0,"4RNrbf80U3VftR5b":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663358898629,"modifiedTime":1663358898858,"lastModifiedBy":"4RNrbf80U3VftR5b"}},{"name":"Tabaxi","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Created by the Cat Lord—a divine being of the Upper Planes—to blend the qualities of humanoids and cats, tabaxi are a varied people in both attitude and appearance.</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed\"><strong>Racial Traits</strong><br />Cat’s Claws, Cat’s Talents, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ]{Darkvision}, Feline Agility</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/25746/883/637880558363345793.png?width=1000&amp;height=1000&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=95&amp;auto=webp\" />\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Increases</b></p>\n<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.

Known as the Shadow Schism, it resulted in a split withinin Phiarlan—and the foundation of House Thuranni. House Phiarlan continues to offer entertainment and espionage in the lands west of the Mournland, while Thuranni operates in the eastern lands. As a rule, Phiarlan elves are the better spies and Thuranni agents are superior assassins. Thuranni and Phiarlan maintain a peaceful relationship, but rivalries run deep.</p>\n<p>Baron Elar d’Thuranni is said to be responsible for the Shadow Schism. Ruling the house from an enclave in Regalport, he is always accompanied by a shadowy pair, rumored to be embodiments of shadow itself. The displacer beast serves as the young house’s emblem.</p>\n<p>The lands of House Phiarlan, known as the Demesnes, are the foremost centers of the arts in the Five Nations, each focusing on a specific artistic tradition: the written word, movement arts, music, material arts, and the arts of illusion, puppetry, oratory, and acting. Baron Elvinor Elorrenthi leads the house from the last of those, the Demesne of Shadow, which is located in Sharn. The hydra serves as House Phiarlan’s emblem.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ]{Darkvision}</b></p>\n<p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you ca<span class=\"No-Break\">n manipulate.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by ma<span class=\"No-Break\">ny societies.</span></p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Necromancy Savant</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>\n\n<p><b>Grim Harvest</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Undead Thralls</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 6th level, you add the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animate dead</span> spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animate dead,</span> you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Inured to Undeath</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can’t be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.</p>\n\n<p><b>Command Undead</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"school-of-necromancy","classIdentifier":"wizard","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"subclassDefinitionId":102139147,"id":55,"importId":"ec7O7MPxp04SBwln"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"School of Necromancy"}}},"img":"icons/skills/trades/academics-book-study-runes.webp","effects":[],"_id":"6XKJVq65mrr0KcJu","folder":null,"sort":20001,"ownership":{"default":0,"4RNrbf80U3VftR5b":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663359072843,"modifiedTime":1663359073119,"lastModifiedBy":"4RNrbf80U3VftR5b"}},{"name":"Wizard","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed;font-size:14px\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Intelligence &amp; Wisdom</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Additional Wizard Spells</b></p>\n<p><em>1st-level wizard feature</em></p>\n<p>The spells in the following list expand the wizard spell list in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em>.

See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the wizard spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cantrip Formulas</b></p>\n<p><em>3rd-level wizard feature</em></p>\n<p>You have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult those formulas in your spellbook, you can replace one wizard cantrip you know with another cantrip from the wizard spell list.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.

Every nation wanted weapons and warforged, along with mundane arms and armor. The war raised the house up, and then tore it down. House Cannith was based in Cyre, and the Mourning destroyed the house leadership and key facilities. Now three barons jockey to fill the leadership vacuum: the alchemist Jorlanna of Fairhaven, weaponsmith Zorlan of Korth, and Merrix of Sharn, innovator of warforged. It remains to be seen whether one of these leaders will unite the house, or if it will shatter under the strain.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal.

@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Stealth}</p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Steady Aim</b></p>\n<p><em>3rd-level rogue feature</em><br />As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible} creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stroke of Luck</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 94","identifier":"rogue","levels":2,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"A9rpLbL5GC3e2WdA","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ApCMpdtXSSpVI6Eq","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"sneak-attack","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"n":1,"die":6},"3":{"n":2,"die":6},"5":{"n":3,"die":6},"7":{"n":4,"die":6},"9":{"n":5,"die":6},"11":{"n":6,"die":6},"13":{"n":7,"die":6},"15":{"n":8,"die":6},"17":{"n":9,"die":6},"19":{"n":10,"die":6}}},"value":{},"title":"Sneak Attack","icon":""}],"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","prc","prf","per","slt","ste"],"value":["ins","dec","inv","prc"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":96992166,"definitionId":12,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"importId":"UlCrZm9zb6CF3vVU"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Rogue"}}},"img":"icons/skills/melee/strike-sword-stabbed-brown.webp","effects":[],"_id":"CTIICYQ9GGNSwUnp","folder":null,"sort":20001,"ownership":{"default":0,"4RNrbf80U3VftR5b":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":1663358951068,"modifiedTime":1663358951266,"lastModifiedBy":"4RNrbf80U3VftR5b"}},{"name":"Kenku","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Whatever their true origin, kenku are most often found in the Shadowfell and the Material Plane, and they tend to have the coloration typical of ravens.</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed\"><strong>Racial Traits</strong><br />Expert Duplication, Kenku Recall, Mimicry</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/25746/856/637880558320001723.png?width=1000&amp;height=1000&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=95&amp;auto=webp\" />\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Increases</b></p>\n<p>When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.
